# ðŸ§  AI Model from Scratch

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

This project builds deep learning models (e.g., CNN, MLP, Transformer, etc.) from scratch. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of how machine learning and deep learning models operate internally. It is a self-learning project that includes both pure scratch implementations using NumPy and corresponding versions implemented with PyTorch.
